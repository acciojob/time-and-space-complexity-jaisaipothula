    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It measures the efficiency of an algorithm concerning time, focusing on how the algorithm behaves as the input size grows. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity.</p>
    
    <p>Space Complexity is a measure of how much auxiliary memory an algorithm needs concerning the input size. It is often denoted using Big-O notation, such as O(n), where n represents the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> analysis helps in understanding the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute efficiently, particularly in situations where memory is constrained.</p>
