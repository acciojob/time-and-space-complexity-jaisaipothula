    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It quantifies the efficiency of an algorithm concerning time. Algorithms with lower time complexity are considered more efficient, as they complete their tasks in less time.</p>
    
    <p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute and complete its task as a function of the input size. It is often denoted using Big-O notation, such as O(n), where n represents the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> analysis helps in understanding how much memory an algorithm needs at its peak during execution. Optimizing space complexity ensures efficient use of memory resources.</p>
